This repository contains the Java projects developed during the Java Programming Internship. The projects include:
Tic Tac Toe Game
Calculator
Expense Tracker
Link Shortener

Projects Overview-

Tic Tac Toe Game
A two-player game where users can play against each other. The game includes a console version, with an optional GUI, that implements the logic for winning conditions and allows for continuous play until a winner or draw is declared.

Calculator
A simple calculator application capable of performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with error handling for invalid input and division by zero. The console-based version can optionally be extended to a GUI version.

Expense Tracker
An application to help users manage their daily expenses by categorizing, adding, viewing, and deleting expenses. The data is stored in a file for persistence, and an optional GUI can be added for a better user experience.

Link Shortener
A URL shortener that generates unique shortened URLs for long URLs. The application includes basic data storage to map and retrieve URLs and provides error handling for invalid URLs.

Technologies Used
Java: Core language for project development.
File Handling: For data persistence in Expense Tracker and Link Shortener.
OOP Principles: For structuring project components and logic.
